# Movies 2 Go

Movies 2 Go is a Movie inventory / sales system that features CRUD (Create, Remove, Delete, Update) functionality that I built. When items are chosen and put through the Order function, prices are calculated automatically (tax is applied as well) and the orders are updated within a SQL Database.

# Getting Started | Step 1

The front end of this project was generated with Angular CLI version 7.3.8.

## Front End - Angular 7

You will need to have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installaed on your device and run `npm install` in order to recieve all dependencies before utilizing the application.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically route you to the `/order` page.

# Step 2 | Back End - ASP.NET - EF - MySQL

The back end of this project was built with ASP.NET Core 2 + Entity Framework + MySQL.

## Downloading Steps

ASPNET Web API is located [Here](https://github.com/zeitlosein/MyWebAPI).

After downloading the API, please open the solution in Visual Studio and run then `run solution with ISSExpress`.

You must run both the front and back end projects `at the same time` in order to utilize the Movie Application.
